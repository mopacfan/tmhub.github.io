change it to another one, create [custom.xml][custom_xml] file and add the
following instruction:

```xml
<catalog_product_view>
    <update handle="page_two_columns_left"/>
</catalog_product_view>
```

Possible values for handle variable:

```
page_two_columns_left

</div><div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--9-col mdl-cell--6-col-tablet">

Brand information block is powered by AttributePages module and displays
image linked with product `manufacturer` attribute.

To make this block active, you should create Attributepage for the `manufacturer`
attribute at `Templates-Master > Attribute Pages > Manage Pages` and upload
images for every attribute option.

You can edit this block at `Cms > Static Blocks`. See the `product_sidebar`
block contents:

```
{% raw %}{{block type="attributepages/product_option" template="tm/attributepages/product/options.phtml" width="180" height="90" use_image="1" image_type="image" use_link="1" attribute_code="manufacturer" css_class="hidden-label"}}{% endraw %}
```

You can also create attribute page for any other attribute. In this case you
will need to change part of the widget code above:

Replace `attribute_code="manufacturer"` with `attribute_code="attribute_code"`
