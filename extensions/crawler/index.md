##### Store View
Tells the crawler which store views to process

##### Crawler Type
Allows you to select set of urls that will be crawled _(Multiple sets are allowed
to select too)_.
There are following crawler types are available:
- Product
- Category
- Cms

##### Currencies
Tells the crawler which currencies to process. If you have different available
currencies per store view, crawler will handle them automatically and process
only available currencies per each store view.

##### User Agents
Useful if you are using theme exceptions for some devices and want to crawl them
too.

**Example 1:**

> You are using ArgentoFlat theme as main theme and MobileStar for iPhone and Android.
In this case you need to set the value of User Agents field to `iPhone`. Please
note that **you should not** add the `Andoid`, because Andoid will use the same design
as iPhone use.

**Example 2:**

> You are using ArgentoFlat theme as main theme, ArgentoArgento for Chrome browser
and MobileStar for iPhone and Android. In this case you need to set the value of
User Agents field to `Chrome,iPhone`. Please note that **you should not** add
the `Andoid`, because Andoid will use the same design as iPhone use.
